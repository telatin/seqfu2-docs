  abstract  = "Sequence files formats (FASTA and FASTQ) are commonly used in
               bioinformatics, molecular biology and biochemistry. With the
               advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, the
               number of FASTQ datasets produced and analyzed has grown
               exponentially, urging the development of dedicated software to
               handle, parse, and manipulate such files efficiently. Several
               bioinformatics packages are available to filter and manipulate
               FASTA and FASTQ files, yet some essential tasks remain poorly
               supported, leaving gaps that any workflow analysis of NGS
               datasets must fill with custom scripts. This can introduce
               harmful variability and performance bottlenecks in pivotal
               steps. Here we present a suite of tools, called SeqFu (Sequence
               Fastx utilities), that provides a broad range of commands to
               perform both common and specialist operations with ease and is
               designed to be easily implemented in high-performance analytical
               pipelines. SeqFu includes high-performance implementation of
               algorithms to interleave and deinterleave FASTQ files, merge
               Illumina lanes, and perform various quality controls
               (identification of degenerate primers, analysis of length
               statistics, extraction of portions of the datasets). SeqFu
               dereplicates sequences from multiple files keeping track of
               their provenance. SeqFu is developed in Nim for high-performance
               processing, is freely available, and can be installed with the
               popular package manager Miniconda.",
